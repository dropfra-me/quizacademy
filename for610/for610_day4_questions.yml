  question: "What is a 'packer' in the context of malware analysis?"
  options:
  - "A tool used to analyze a program's network traffic."
  - "A legitimate program used to compress and protect intellectual property, which is also misused by malware authors."
  - "A program that executes malicious code inside a sandbox environment."
  - "A tool that detects and removes malicious files from a system."
  correct_answer: "A legitimate program used to compress and protect intellectual property, which is also misused by malware authors."
  explanation: "A packer is a tool that compresses, obfuscates, encrypts, or otherwise encodes the original code to make it more difficult for analysts to reverse-engineer and for anti-malware tools to recognize. They are used by both legitimate developers and malware authors."

  question: "When analyzing a Windows executable, which of the following is NOT a typical indicator that a file might be packed?"
  options:
  - "The file has few readable strings."
  - "The file's sections have unusually low entropy."
  - "The Import Address Table (IAT) is small or contains few recognizable functions."
  - "The names of the file sections are uncommon, such as 'UPX0' or 'NPX1'."
  correct_answer: "The file's sections have unusually low entropy."
  explanation: "A packed executable, which contains compressed or encrypted data, is expected to have high entropy, not low. Low entropy is typical of normal, nonpacked files."

  question: "What is the purpose of disabling the `DynamicBase` flag in a PE header?"
  options:
  - "To enable the program to run in a 64-bit environment."
  - "To force Windows to honor the program's preferred `ImageBase` address."
  - "To compress the executable file for easier storage."
  - "To remove all dependencies on external DLLs."
  correct_answer: "To force Windows to honor the program's preferred `ImageBase` address."
  explanation: "Disabling the `DynamicBase` flag tells Windows to ignore ASLR and load the executable at its preferred `ImageBase` address, making memory addresses consistent for analysis."

  - "The memory region can be executed, read from, and written to."
  - "The memory region is only used for storing file paths."
  correct_answer: "The memory region can be executed, read from, and written to."
  explanation: "The `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` flag (`0x40`) grants a memory region permissions for execution, reading, and writing, which is a common indicator of a code injection attempt."

  type: "multiple_choice"
  question: "What is a major difference between a traditional executable and a .NET program?"
  options:
  - ".NET programs contain CIL bytecode instead of native machine opcodes."
  - "Traditional executables are always 64-bit, while .NET programs are 32-bit."
  - "Traditional executables are platform-independent, while .NET programs are not."
  - ".NET programs do not have an .exe or .dll extension."
  correct_answer: ".NET programs contain CIL bytecode instead of native machine opcodes."
  explanation: ".NET programs contain Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode that is translated into native code by a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler at runtime, whereas traditional programs contain opcodes the CPU can execute directly."

  question: "The multi-stage malware sample PDFXCview.exe was described as a 'fileless' specimen. Why?"
  options:
  - "It deletes its executable from the system immediately after running."
  - "It does not store malicious code directly on the file system, but rather in the registry."
  - "It only exists in the system's memory and is never written to disk."
  - "It can infect a system without requiring the user to open a document."
  correct_answer: "It does not store malicious code directly on the file system, but rather in the registry."
  explanation: "The PDFXCview.exe specimen is described as 'fileless' because it keeps its malicious scripts and encoded executable code in the registry to maintain a persistent presence without storing them directly on the file system."

- category: "In-Depth Malware Analysis"
  type: "true_false"
  question: "The `setdllcharacteristics` tool permanently changes the behavior of an executable, even if it is moved to a different system."
  correct_answer: true
  explanation: "The tool modifies the PE header of the file itself, so the change is persistent and travels with the file."
- category: "In-Depth Malware Analysis"
  type: "true_false"
  question: "A program compiled into an assembly for the .NET Framework will contain machine code that can be directly executed by the CPU."

- category: "In-Depth Malware Analysis"
  type: "true_false"
  question: "The tool `de4dot` is a debugger, and it is used to analyze .NET malware at runtime."
