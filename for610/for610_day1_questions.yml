  question: "During a behavioral analysis of a specimen, a malware analyst observes the creation of a named 'mutant' object. What is a common purpose of such an object in malware?"
  options:
  - "To establish command and control (C2) communication"
  - "To exfiltrate stolen data to an external server"
  - "To avoid reinfecting a host by acting as an infection marker"
  - "To gain administrative privileges on the compromised system"
  correct_answer: "To avoid reinfecting a host by acting as an infection marker"
  explanation: "A mutant is a flag that programs can use to serialize access to a resource. Malware sometimes uses a mutant to avoid reinfecting a host, acting as an infection marker. The specimen might exit if the mutant already exists."

  question: "Which of the following is a primary risk of sharing a malware sample with a public analysis service like VirusTotal during an investigation of a targeted attack?"
  options:
  - "The service will incorrectly analyze the specimen."
  - "The sample might contain sensitive PII that could be leaked."
  - "The attacker might discover they've been found by monitoring the service for the specimen's hash."
